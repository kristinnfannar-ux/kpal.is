<h3>Structural survey and damage mapping with real time document control</h3>

<p> 
KPAL offers a complete set of solutions to assess and maintain the integrity of structural repair records for any airframe.<br>
By using the combined power of our engineers in depth knowledge and the dedicated structural damage mapping and records keeping program dent & buckle, we enable owners and operators to produce an up to date report of each airframe status at any given time.</p>

<p>
This service joins together the user-friendly damage recording software dent & buckle along with real time professional support from a crew of experienced engineers to deliver one of a kind third party solution for all airframe structural issues.</p>

<p>
Our services can be used both for “benchmarking” aircraft during import/export and also to provide continuous oversight during the life of the aircraft.<br>
In addition, customers can generate a suite of reports as required to get a comprehensive overview of each aircraft status.
